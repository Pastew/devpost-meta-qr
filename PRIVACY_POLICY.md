# Privacy Policy for Devpost Meta Horizon QR

**Last updated:** December 11, 2025

## 1. Data Collection
We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or user usage data. Consider us "zero-knowledge" software.

## 2. Usage of Permissions
This extension requires access to `devpost.com` pages solely for the purpose of identifying "Try it out" links in the visible page content and generating a QR code image locally within your browser.

## 3. Third-Party Services
This extension includes `qrcodejs`, a third-party library, which runs locally on your device and does not transmit data.
